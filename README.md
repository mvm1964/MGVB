# MGVB
This library contains code and binaries of the MGVB pipeline for computational proteomics.  

To install and run the pipeline, download the zip file, extract to appropriate location and follow the instructions in docs/appendix.pdf.  

As of 5.12.2024, the latest version is v0.0.3, which has improved deisotoping and monoisotopic mass determination, which improves coverage for very complex samples such as whole proteome phosphopeptide analysis.
