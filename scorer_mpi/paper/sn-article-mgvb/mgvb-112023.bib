These two nodes, along with the existing Percolator validation module, allow users to employ different search strategies and conveniently inspect search results through PD. Our results have demonstrated the improved numbers of PSMs, peptides, and proteins identified by MSFragger coupled with Percolator and significantly faster search speed compared to the conventional SEQUEST/Percolator PD workflows.

We have previously described MSFragger, an ultrafast search engine for proteomics, that did not utilize deisotoping in processing input spectra. Here, we present a new, high-speed parallelized deisotoping algorithm, based on elements of several existing methods, that we have incorporated into the MSFragger search engine. Applying deisotoping with MSFragger reveals substantial improvements to database search speed and performance, particularly for complex methods like open or nonspecific searches. Finally, we evaluate our deisotoping method on data from several instrument types and vendors, revealing a wide range in performance and offering an updated perspective on deisotoping in the modern proteomics environment.},

   journal = {J Proteomics},
   volume = {207},
   pages = {103467},
   abstract = {The mating-specific yeast Galpha controls pheromone signaling by sequestering Gbetagamma and by regulating the Fus3 MAP kinase. Disrupting Galpha-Fus3 interaction leads to severe defects in chemotropism. Because Galpha concentrates at the chemotropic growth site where Fus3 is required for the phosphorylation of two known targets, we screened for additional proteins whose phosphorylation depends on pheromone stimulation and Galpha-Fus3 interaction. Using a mutant form of Galpha severely defective in Fus3-binding, Galpha(DSD), and quantitative mass spectrometry, fourteen proteins were identified as potential targets of Galpha-recruited Fus3, ten of which were previously implicated in cell polarity and morphogenesis. To explore the biological relevance of these findings, we focused on the Spa2 polarisome protein, which was hypophosphorylated on multiple serine residues in pheromone-treated Galpha(DSD) cells. Six sites were mutagenized to create the Spa2(6XSA) mutant protein. Spa2(6XSA) exhibited increased affinity for Fus3, consistent with a kinase-substrate interaction, and Spa2(6XSA) cells exhibited dramatic defects in gradient sensing and zygote formation. These results suggest that Galpha promotes the phosphorylation of Spa2 by Fus3 at the cortex of pheromone-stimulated cells, and that this mechanism plays a role in chemotropism. How the Galpha-Fus3 signaling hub affects the other putative targets identified here has yet to be determined. SIGNIFICANCE: Previously, interaction between the G alpha protein, Gpa1, and the MAPK of the pheromone response pathway, Fus3, was shown to be important for efficient sensing of the pheromone gradient and for the maintenance of cell polarity during mating. Here we show that the underlying molecular mechanisms involve the phosphorylation of specific cortical targets of Gpa1/Fus3. These have been identified by quantitative phosphoproteomics using a mutant of Gpa1, which is defective in interacting with Fus3. One of these targets is the polarisome protein Spa2. Alanine substitution of the Spa2 phosphorylation sites targeted by Gpa1/Fus3 lead to a dramatic defect in pheromone gradient sensing and zygote formation. These results reveal how the G alpha protein and the MAPK control cell polarity in a prototypical model system. Our results have wider significance as similar mechanisms exist in higher eukaryotes and are involved in important biological such as neuron development, immunity, and cancer cell metastasis.},

We further illustrate its utility using protein-RNA cross-linked peptide data and using affinity purification experiments where we observe, on average, a 300% increase in the number of identified spectra for enriched proteins. We also discuss the benefits of open searching for improved false discovery rate estimation in proteomics.},

Conserved exons encoding the leucine-rich repeats tend to be overexpressed while others are underused. Mechanistic studies revealed that the underused exons encode part of the protein necessary for interaction with Vimentin and Numa1, a protein which is required for proper positioning of the mitotic spindle. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion of specific SCRIB exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer, which could potentially be exploited to develop more efficient diagnostics and therapies.},

   abstract = {Gradient-directed cell migration (chemotaxis) and growth (chemotropism) are processes that are essential to the development and life cycles of all species. Cells use surface receptors to sense the shallow chemical gradients that elicit chemotaxis and chemotropism. Slight asymmetries in receptor activation are amplified by downstream signaling systems, which ultimately induce dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. During the mating response of budding yeast, a model chemotropic system, the pheromone receptors on the plasma membrane polarize to the side of the cell closest to the stimulus. Although receptor polarization occurs before and independently of actin cable-dependent delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane (directed secretion), it requires receptor internalization. Phosphorylation of pheromone receptors by yeast casein kinase 1 or 2 (Yck1/2) stimulates their internalization. We showed that the pheromone-responsive Gbetagamma dimer promotes the polarization of the pheromone receptor by interacting with Yck1/2 and locally inhibiting receptor phosphorylation. We also found that receptor phosphorylation is essential for chemotropism, independently of its role in inducing receptor internalization. A mathematical model supports the idea that the interaction between Gbetagamma and Yck1/2 results in differential phosphorylation and internalization of the pheromone receptor and accounts for its polarization before the initiation of directed secretion.},

   abstract = {Metastatic cancer cells form pseudopodia (PD) to facilitate their migration. The proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) transduces migratory signals from proteases, and it forms protein complexes with beta-arrestin and other signalling molecules that are enriched in pseudopodia. More generally, however, pseudopodial regulation is poorly understood. Here, we purified the pseudopodial proteomes of breast cancer cells after activation of the endogenous PAR-2 and we combined gel-based approaches with label-free high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify proteins that accumulate at the pseudopodia upon PAR-2-mediated migration. We identified >410 proteins in the cell body and >380 in the pseudopodia upon PAR2 activation, of which 93 were enriched in the pseudopodia. One of the pathways strongly enriched in the PD was the clathrin-mediated endocytosis signalling pathway, highlighting the importance of the scaffolding function of beta-arrestin in PAR-2 signalling via its endocytosis. We therefore immunoprecipitated beta-arrestins, and with mass spectrometry we identified 418 novel putative interactors. These data revealed novel beta-arrestin functions that specifically control PAR-2-regulated signalling in migrating breast cancer cells but also showed that some beta-arrestin functions are universal between GPCRs and cell types. In conclusion, this study reveals novel proteins and signalling pathways potentially important for migration of breast cancer cells.},

Furthermore, using epithelial cell lines expressing CD74 under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter and quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that, as a result of CD74 overexpression, the phosphorylation pattern of the C-terminal part of Scribble undergoes specific changes. This is accompanied with a translocation of the protein from the sites of cell-to-cell contacts at the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, which is likely to effectively enhance the motility and invasiveness of the cancer cells.},

There are no established markers and targets that can be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed, it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.

Furthermore, it can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, is able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. The algorithms of Andromeda are provided. Andromeda can function independently or as an integrated search engine of the widely used MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and both are freely available at www.maxquant.org. The combination enables analysis of large data sets in a simple analysis workflow on a desktop computer. For searching individual spectra Andromeda is also accessible via a web server. We demonstrate the flexibility of the system by implementing the capability to identify cofragmented peptides, significantly improving the total number of identified peptides.},

   abstract = {As a budding yeast cell elongates toward its mating partner, cytoplasmic microtubules connect the nucleus to the cell cortex at the growth tip. The Kar3 kinesin-like motor protein is then thought to stimulate plus-end depolymerization of these microtubules, thus drawing the nucleus closer to the site where cell fusion and karyogamy will occur. Here, we show that pheromone stimulates a microtubule-independent interaction between Kar3 and the mating-specific Galpha protein Gpa1 and that Gpa1 affects both microtubule orientation and cortical contact. The membrane localization of Gpa1 was found to polarize early in the mating response, at about the same time that the microtubules begin to attach to the incipient growth site. In the absence of Gpa1, microtubules lose contact with the cortex upon shrinking and Kar3 is improperly localized, suggesting that Gpa1 is a cortical anchor for Kar3. We infer that Gpa1 serves as a positional determinant for Kar3-bound microtubule plus ends during mating.},

Experimental results confirm maximum FWHM resolving power in excess of 350,000 at m/z 524 and 600,000 at m/z 195, isotopic resolution of proteins above 40 kDa, and a single-shot dynamic range of 25,000. It was also found that mass shifts in the new design depend very little on space charge inside the analyzer. This performance was achieved using higher voltages and by careful balancing of construction tolerances and operation parameters, which appeared to vary in narrower ranges of tuning than for a standard Orbitrap analyzer.},

   abstract = {Proteomics is rapidly transforming the way that cancer and other pathologies are investigated. The ability to identify hundreds of proteins and to compare their abundance in different clinical samples presents a unique opportunity for direct identification of novel disease markers. Furthermore, recent advances allow us to analyse and compare PTMs. This gives an additional dimension for defining a new class of protein biomarker based not only on abundance and expression but also on the occurrence of covalent modifications specific to a disease state or therapy response. Such modifications are often a consequence of the activation/inactivation of a particular disease related pathway. In this review we evaluate the available information on breast cancer related protein-phosphorylation events, illustrating the rationale for investigating this PTM as a target for breast cancer research with eventual clinical relevance. We present a critical survey of the published experimental strategies to study protein phosphorylation on a system wide scale and highlight recent specific advances in breast cancer phosphoproteomics. Finally we discuss the feasibility of establishing novel biomarkers for breast cancer based on the detection of patterns of specific protein phosphorylation events.},

By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of >4,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates.},

Label-free quantitation was used to generate protein abundance maps for each proteome and perform comparative analyses. The mass spectrometry data revealed distinct qualitative and quantitative patterns distinguishing the tumors from healthy tissue as well as differences between metastatic and non-metastatic human breast cancers including many established and potential novel candidate protein biomarkers. Selected proteins were evaluated by Western blotting using tumors grouped according to histological grade, size, and receptor expression but differing in nodal status. Immunohistochemical analysis of a wide panel of breast tumors was conducted to assess expression in different types of breast cancers and the cellular distribution of the candidate proteins. These experiments provided further insights and an independent validation of the data obtained by mass spectrometry and revealed the potential of this approach for establishing multimodal markers for early metastasis, therapy outcomes, prognosis, and diagnosis in the future.},

Image current detection is subsequently performed after a stable electrostatic field is achieved. Fourier transformation of the acquired transient allows wide mass range detection with high resolving power, mass accuracy, and dynamic range. The entire instrument operates in LC/MS mode (1 spectrum/s) with nominal mass resolving power of 60,000 and uses automatic gain control to provide high-accuracy mass measurements, within 2 ppm using internal standards and within 5 ppm with external calibration. The maximum resolving power exceeds 100,000 (fwhm). Rapid, automated data-dependent capabilities enable real-time acquisition of up to three high-mass accuracy MS/MS spectra per second.},

Recently developed methods that couple multidimensional liquid chromatography to electrospray mass spectrometers can be used to analyze entire phosphoproteomes. However, they require considerable investments and technical skills that are only available in a few highly specialized laboratories. These methods also appear to be biased. Statistical analyses show that peptides from abundant proteins and multiply phosphorylated peptides are disproportionately identified. We describe an economic alternative that utilizes a phospho-affinity step to isolate the intact phosphoproteins. These are subsequently characterized by electrophoresis and identified by direct de novo sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry. We applied this technique to probe signal-induced changes in the phosphoproteome of human U937 cells, and found that the pools of two cancer-related phosphoproteins implicated in intracellular hormones signaling are dramatically altered in the course of monocyte to macrophage differentiation.},

Bni1p, a formin homologue, is required for this polarized growth by facilitating cortical actin cable assembly. Fus3p, a pheromone-activated MAP kinase, is required for pheromone signaling and cell fusion. We show that Fus3p phosphorylates Bni1p in vitro, and phosphorylation of Bni1p in vivo during the pheromone response is dependent on Fus3p. fus3 mutants exhibited multiple phenotypes similar to bni1 mutants, including defects in actin and cell polarization, as well as Kar9p and cytoplasmic microtubule localization. Disruption of the interaction between Fus3p and the receptor-associated Galpha subunit caused similar mutant phenotypes. After pheromone treatment, Bni1p-GFP and Spa2p failed to localize to the cortex of fus3 mutants, and cell wall growth became completely unpolarized. Bni1p overexpression suppressed the actin assembly, cell polarization, and cell fusion defects. These data suggest a model wherein activated Fus3p is recruited back to the cortex, where it activates Bni1p to promote polarization and cell fusion.},

The pheromone-responsive G protein alpha subunit (Galpha) of yeast down-regulates the mating signal, but its targets are unknown.

We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

   abstract = {Extraction of data from the proprietary RAW files generated by Thermo Fisher mass spectrometers is the primary step for subsequent data analysis. High resolution and high mass accuracy data obtained by state-of-the-art mass spectrometers (e.g., Orbitraps) can significantly improve both peptide/protein identification and quantification. We developed RawConverter, a stand-alone software tool, to improve data extraction on RAW files from high-resolution Thermo Fisher mass spectrometers. RawConverter extracts full scan and MS(n) data from RAW files like its predecessor RawXtract; most importantly, it associates the accurate precursor mass-to-charge (m/z) value with the tandem mass spectrum. RawConverter accepts RAW data generated by either data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or data-independent acquisition (DIA). It generates output into MS1/MS2/MS3, MGF, or mzXML file formats, which fulfills the format requirements for most data identification and quantification tools. Using the tandem mass spectra extracted by RawConverter with corrected m/z values, 32.8%, 27.1%, and 84.1%, peptide spectra matches (PSMs) produce 17.4% (13.0%), 14.4% (11.5%), and 45.7% (36.2%) more peptide (protein) identifications than ProteoWizard, pXtract, and RawXtract, respectively.
