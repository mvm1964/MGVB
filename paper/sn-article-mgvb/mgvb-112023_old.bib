Although signal transmission by such pathways has been modeled in detail, postreceptor down-regulation is less well understood. The pheromone-responsive G protein $\alpha$ subunit (G$\alpha$) of yeast down-regulates the mating signal, but its targets are unknown. We have found that G$\alpha$ binds directly to the mating-specific MAPK in yeast cells responding to pheromone. This interaction contributes both to modulation of the mating signal and to the chemotropic response, and it demonstrates direct communication between the top and bottom of a G$\alpha$-MAPK pathway. </jats:p>},

Bni1p, a formin homologue, is required for this polarized growth by facilitating cortical actin cable assembly. Fus3p, a pheromone-activated MAP kinase, is required for pheromone signaling and cell fusion. We show that Fus3p phosphorylates Bni1p in vitro, and phosphorylation of Bni1p in vivo during the pheromone response is dependent on Fus3p. fus3 mutants exhibited multiple phenotypes similar to bni1 mutants, including defects in actin and cell polarization, as well as Kar9p and cytoplasmic microtubule localization. Disruption of the interaction between Fus3p and the receptor-associated Gα subunit caused similar mutant phenotypes. After pheromone treatment, Bni1p-GFP and Spa2p failed to localize to the cortex of fus3 mutants, and cell wall growth became completely unpolarized. Bni1p overexpression suppressed the actin assembly, cell polarization, and cell fusion defects. These data suggest a model wherein activated Fus3p is recruited back to the cortex, where it activates Bni1p to promote polarization and cell fusion.</jats:p>},

Recently developed methods that couple multidimensional liquid chromatography to electrospray mass spectrometers can be used to analyze entire phosphoproteomes. However, they require considerable investments and technical skills that are only available in a few highly specialized laboratories. These methods also appear to be biased. Statistical analyses show that peptides from abundant proteins and multiply phosphorylated peptides are disproportionately identified. We describe an economic alternative that utilizes a phospho-affinity step to isolate the intact phosphoproteins. These are subsequently characterized by electrophoresis and identified by direct de novo sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry. We applied this technique to probe signal-induced changes in the phosphoproteome of human U937 cells, and found that the pools of two cancer-related phosphoproteins implicated in intracellular hormones signaling are dramatically altered in the course of monocyte to macrophage differentiation.},

Label-free quantitation was used to generate protein abundance maps for each proteome and perform comparative analyses. The mass spectrometry data revealed distinct qualitative and quantitative patterns distinguishing the tumors from healthy tissue as well as differences between metastatic and non-metastatic human breast cancers including many established and potential novel candidate protein biomarkers. Selected proteins were evaluated by Western blotting using tumors grouped according to histological grade, size, and receptor expression but differing in nodal status. Immunohistochemical analysis of a wide panel of breast tumors was conducted to assess expression in different types of breast cancers and the cellular distribution of the candidate proteins. These experiments provided further insights and an independent validation of the data obtained by mass spectrometry and revealed the potential of this approach for establishing multimodal markers for early metastasis, therapy outcomes, prognosis, and diagnosis in the future. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

In this article, we have studied this complex in leaves and have shown that dissociation and reassociation of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex occurs in a time frame of minutes, allowing for rapid regulation of enzyme activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the extent of formation and dissociation of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex correlates with the quantity of light. These data provide evidence linking the status of this complex with the rapid and subtle regulation of GAPDH and PRK activities in response to fluctuations in light availability. We have also demonstrated that dissociation of this complex depends on electron transport chain activity and that the major factor involved in the dissociation of the pea complex was thioredoxin <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> . We show here that both PRK and GAPDH are present in the reduced form in leaves in the dark, but are inactive, demonstrating the role of the PRK/GAPDH/CP12 complex in deactivating these enzymes in response to reductions in light intensity.

   abstract = {Implantation of mammalian embryos into their mother's uterus ensures optimal nourishment and protection throughout development. Complex molecular interactions characterize the implantation process, and an optimal synchronization of the components of this embryo-maternal dialogue is crucial for a successful reproductive outcome. In the present study, we investigated the role of dendritic cells (DC) during implantation process using a transgenic mouse system (DTRtg) that allows transient depletion of CD11c+ cells in vivo through administration of diphtheria toxin. We observed that DC depletion impairs the implantation process, resulting in a reduced breeding efficiency. Furthermore, the maturity of uterine natural killer cells at dendritic cell knockout (DCKO) implantation sites was affected as well; as demonstrated by decreased perforin expression and reduced numbers of periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive cells. This was accompanied by disarrangements in decidual vascular development. In the present study, we were also able to identify a novel DC-dependent protein, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein β (PITPβ), involved in implantation and trophoblast development using a proteomic approach. Indeed, DCKO mice exhibited substantial anomalies in placental development, including hypocellularity of the spongiotrophoblast and labyrinthine layers and reduced numbers of trophoblast giant cells. Giant cells also down-regulated their expression of two characteristic markers of trophoblast differentiation, placental lactogen 1 and proliferin. In view of these findings, dendritic cells emerge as possible modulators in the orchestration of events leading to the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

The ability to identify hundreds of proteins and to compare their abundance in different clinical samples presents a unique opportunity for direct identification of novel disease markers. Furthermore, recent advances allow us to analyse and compare PTMs. This gives an additional dimension for defining a new class of protein biomarker based not only on abundance and expression but also on the occurrence of covalent modifications specific to a disease state or therapy response. Such modifications are often a consequence of the activation/inactivation of a particular disease related pathway. In this review we evaluate the available information on breast cancer related protein-phosphorylation events, illustrating the rationale for investigating this PTM as a target for breast cancer research with eventual clinical relevance. We present a critical survey of the published experimental strategies to study protein phosphorylation on a system wide scale and highlight recent specific advances in breast cancer phosphoproteomics.

Here, we show that pheromone stimulates a microtubule-independent interaction between Kar3 and the mating-specific Gα protein Gpa1 and that Gpa1 affects both microtubule orientation and cortical contact. The membrane localization of Gpa1 was found to polarize early in the mating response, at about the same time that the microtubules begin to attach to the incipient growth site. In the absence of Gpa1, microtubules lose contact with the cortex upon shrinking and Kar3 is improperly localized, suggesting that Gpa1 is a cortical anchor for Kar3. We infer that Gpa1 serves as a positional determinant for Kar3-bound microtubule plus ends during mating.</jats:p>},

PRK and GAPDH are inactivated when present in this complex, a process shown in vitro to be dependent upon oxidized CP12. The importance of CP12 in vivo in higher plants, however, has not been investigated. Here, antisense suppression of CP12 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was observed to impact on NAD-induced PRK and GAPDH complex formation but had little effect on enzyme activity. Additionally, only minor changes in photosynthetic carbon fixation were observed. Despite this, antisense plants displayed changes in growth rates and morphology, including dwarfism and reduced apical dominance. The hypothesis that CP12 is essential to separate oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity from Calvin-Benson cycle activity, as proposed in cyanobacteria, was tested. No evidence was found to support this role in tobacco. Evidence was seen, however, for a restriction to malate valve capacity, with decreases in NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity (but not protein levels) and pyridine nucleotide content. Antisense repression of CP12 also led to significant changes in carbon partitioning, with increased carbon allocation to the cell wall and the organic acids malate and fumarate and decreased allocation to starch and soluble carbohydrates. Severe decreases were also seen in 2-oxoglutarate content, a key indicator of cellular carbon sufficiency. The data presented here indicate that in tobacco, CP12 has a role in redox-mediated regulation of carbon partitioning from the chloroplast and provides strong in vivo evidence that CP12 is required for normal growth and development in plants.</jats:p>},

   abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed, it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.

CD74, the cell surface isoform of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain, is one such molecule; its role remains poorly defined. To address this, we have employed a high-resolution single-particle imaging method for quantifying the colocalization of CD74 with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules on human fibroblast cells known for their capacity to function as antigen-presenting cells. We have also examined whether the colocalization induces internalization of HLA-DR using HA307-319, a "universal" peptide that binds specifically to the peptide-binding groove of all HLA-DR molecules, irrespective of their alleles. We have determined that 25 ± 1.3% of CD74 and 17 ± 0.3% of HLA-DR are colocalized, and the association of CD74 with HLA-DR and the internalization of HLA-DR are both inhibited by HA 307-319. A similar inhibition of HLA-DR internalization was observed in freshly isolated monocyte-derived dendritic cells. A key role of CD74 is to translocate HLA-DR molecules to early endosomes for reloading with peptides prior to recycling to the cell surface. We conclude that CD74 regulates the balance of peptide-occupied and peptide-free forms of MHC class II at the cell surface. © FASEB.},

Chemotropic growth depends on both the pheromone receptor and its associated G-protein. Upon activation by the receptor, Gα dissociates from Gβγ and Gβ is subsequently phosphorylated. Free Gβγ signals to the nucleus via a MAPK cascade and recruits Far1-Cdc24 to the incipient growth site. It is not clear how the cell establishes and stabilizes the axis of polarity, but this process is thought to require local signal amplification via the Gβγ-Far1-Cdc24 chemotropic complex, as well as communication between this complex and the activated receptor. Here we show that a mutant form of Gβ that cannot be phosphorylated confers defects in directional sensing and chemotropic growth.

We tested the hypothesis that changes in the light dependencies of photosynthesis, nonphotochemical quenching and PSII photoinactivation arises from changes in the abundances of chloroplast proteins in Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP 1516 grown at 30 (Low Light; LL) and 1000 (High Light; HL) μmol photons m-2 s-1 photon flux densities. Carbon-specific light-saturated gross photosynthesis rates were not significantly different between cells acclimated to LL and HL. Acclimation to LL benefited cells by increasing biomass-specific light absorption and gross photosynthesis rates under low light, whereas acclimation to HL benefited cells by reducing the rate of photoinactivation of PSII under high light. Differences in the relative abundances of proteins assigned to light-harvesting (Lhcf), photoprotection (LI818-like), and the photosystem II (PSII) core complex accompanied differences in photophysiology: specifically, Lhcf:PSII was greater under LL, whereas LI818:PSII was greater in HL. Thus, photoacclimation in E. huxleyi involved a trade-off amongst the characteristics of light absorption and photoprotection, which could be attributed to changes in the abundance and composition of proteins in the light-harvesting antenna of PSII. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

Here, we show that when CD74 is overexpressed in human cancer and noncancerous epithelial cells, it interacts and interferes with the function of Scribble, a product of a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, using epithelial cell lines expressing CD74 under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter and quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that, as a result of CD74 overexpression, the phosphorylation pattern of the C-terminal part of Scribble undergoes specific changes. This is accompanied with a translocation of the protein from the sites of cell-to-cell contacts at the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, which is likely to effectively enhance the motility and invasiveness of the cancer cells. © 2013 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

   abstract = {Metastatic cancer cells form pseudopodia (PD) to facilitate their migration. The proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) transduces migratory signals from proteases, and it forms protein complexes with β-arrestin and other signalling molecules that are enriched in pseudopodia. More generally, however, pseudopodial regulation is poorly understood. Here, we purified the pseudopodial proteomes of breast cancer cells after activation of the endogenous PAR-2 and we combined gel-based approaches with label-free high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify proteins that accumulate at the pseudopodia upon PAR-2-mediated migration. We identified > 410 proteins in the cell body and > 380 in the pseudopodia upon PAR2 activation, of which 93 were enriched in the pseudopodia. One of the pathways strongly enriched in the PD was the clathrin-mediated endocytosis signalling pathway, highlighting the importance of the scaffolding function of β-arrestin in PAR-2 signalling via its endocytosis. We therefore immunoprecipitated β-arrestins, and with mass spectrometry we identified 418 novel putative interactors. These data revealed novel β-arrestin functions that specifically control PAR-2-regulated signalling in migrating breast cancer cells but also showed that some β-arrestin functions are universal between GPCRs and cell types. In conclusion, this study reveals novel proteins and signalling pathways potentially important for migration of breast cancer cells. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Background: Microarray technology, as well as other functional genomics experiments, allow simultaneous measurements of thousands of genes within each sample. Both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of a classifier could be enhanced by performing the classification based only on selected discriminative genes. We propose a statistical method for selecting genes based on overlapping analysis of expression data across classes. This method results in a novel measure, called proportional overlapping score (POS), of a feature's relevance to a classification task.Results: We apply POS, along-with four widely used gene selection methods, to several benchmark gene expression datasets. The experimental results of classification error rates computed using the Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine classifiers show that POS achieves a better performance.Conclusions: A novel gene selection method, POS, is proposed. POS analyzes the expressions overlap across classes taking into account the proportions of overlapping samples. It robustly defines a mask for each gene that allows it to minimize the effect of expression outliers. The constructed masks along-with a novel gene score are exploited to produce the selected subset of genes.},

Emiliania huxleyi, a ubiquitous phytoplankter that plays key roles in primary production, calcium carbonate precipitation and production of dimethyl sulfide, often blooms in mid-latitude at the beginning of summer when inorganic nutrient concentrations are low. To understand physiological mechanisms that allow such blooms, we examined how the proteome of E. huxleyi (strain 1516) responds to N and P limitation. We observed modest changes in much of the proteome despite large physiological changes (e.g. cellular biomass, C, N and P) associated with nutrient limitation of growth rate. Acclimation to nutrient limitation did however involve significant increases in the abundance of transporters for ammonium and nitrate under N limitation and for phosphate under P limitation. More notable were large increases in proteins involved in the acquisition of organic forms of N and P, including urea and amino acid/polyamine transporters and numerous C-N hydrolases under N limitation and a large upregulation of alkaline phosphatase under P limitation. This highly targeted reorganization of the proteome towards scavenging organic forms of macronutrients gives unique insight into the molecular mechanisms that underpin how E. huxleyi has found its niche to bloom in surface waters depleted of inorganic nutrients.},

   abstract = {The advent of genomic-, transcriptomic- and proteomic-based approaches has revolutionized our ability to describe marine microbial communities, including biogeography, metabolic potential and diversity, mechanisms of adaptation, and phylogeny and evolutionary history. New interdisciplinary approaches are needed to move from this descriptive level to improved quantitative, process-level understanding of the roles of marine microbes in biogeochemical cycles and of the impact of environmental change on the marine microbial ecosystem. Linking studies at levels from the genome to the organism, to ecological strategies and organism and ecosystem response, requires new modelling approaches. Key to this will be a fundamental shift in modelling scale that represents micro-organisms from the level of their macromolecular components. This will enable contact with omics data sets and allow acclimation and adaptive response at the phenotype level (i.e. traits) to be simulated as a combination of fitness maximization and evolutionary constraints. This way forward will build on ecological approaches that identify key organism traits and systems biology approaches that integrate traditional physiological measurements with new insights from omics. It will rely on developing an improved understanding of ecophysiology to understand quantitatively environmental controls on microbial growth strategies. It will also incorporate results from experimental evolution studies in the representation of adaptation. The resulting ecosystem-level models can then evaluate our level of understanding of controls on ecosystem structure and function, highlight major gaps in understanding and help prioritize areas for future research programs. Ultimately, this grand synthesis should improve predictive capability of the ecosystem response to multiple environmental drivers.},

Around 53% of the tumours present with good tumor regression after nCRT, and 8%-15% are complete responders. Reliable selection markers would allow the identification of poor or non-responders prior to therapy. Tumor biopsies were harvested from 20 patients with rectal carcinomas, and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to therapy after obtaining patients’ informed consent (Erlangen-No.3784). Patients received standardized nCRT with 5-Fluoruracil (nCRT I) or 5-Fluoruracil ± Oxaliplatin (nCRT II) according to the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 protocol. After surgery, regression grading (Dworak) of the tumors was performed during histopathological examination of the specimens. Tumors were classified as poor (Dworak 1 + 2) or good (Dworak 3 + 4) responders. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) for tumor enrichment was performed on preoperative biopsies. Differences in expressed proteins between poor and good responders to nCRT I and II were identified by proteomic analysis (Isotope Coded Protein Label, ICPL™) and selected markers were validated by immunohistochemistry. Tumors of 10 patients were classified as histopathologically poor (Dworak 1 or 2) and the other 10 tumor samples as histopathologically good (Dworak 3 or 4) responders to nCRT after surgery. Sufficient material in good quality was harvested for ICPL analysis by LCM from all biopsies. We identified 140 differentially regulated proteins regarding the selection criteria and the response to nCRT. Fourteen of these proteins were synchronously up-regulated at least 1.5-fold after nCRT I or nCRT II (e.g., FLNB, TKT, PKM2, SERINB1, IGHG2). Thirty-five proteins showed a complete reciprocal regulation (up or down) after nCRT I or nCRT II and the rest was regulated either according to nCRT I or II. The protein expression of regulated proteins such as PLEC1, TKT, HADHA and TAGLN was validated successfully by immunohistochemistry. ICPL is a valid method to identify differentially expressed proteins in rectal carcinoma tissue between poor vs. good responders to nCRT. The identified protein markers may act as selection criteria for nCRT in the future, but our preliminary findings must be reproduced and validated in a prospective cohort.},

Limited data exist on NOD1 and NOD2 expression in human and mouse Sertoli cells. Currently, there is no data on inflammasome expression or function in Sertoli cells. We found that in primary pre-pubertal Sertoli cells and in adult Sertoli line, TLR4\NOD1 and NOD2 crosstalk converged in NF?B activation and elicited a NALP3 activation, leading to de novo synthesis and inflammasome priming. This led to caspase-1 activation and IL-1? secretion. We demonstrated this process was controlled by mechanisms linked to autophagy. NOD1 promoted pro-IL-1? restriction and autophagosome maturation arrest, while NOD2 promoted caspase-1 activation, IL-1? secretion and autophagy maturation. NALP3 modulated NOD1 and pro-IL-1? expression, while NOD2 inversely promoted IL-1?. This study is proof of concept that Sertoli cells, upon specific stimulation, could participate in male infertility pathogenesis via inflammatory cytokine induction.},

   abstract = {Gradient-directed cell migration (chemotaxis) and growth (chemotropism) are processes that are essential to the development and life cycles of all species. Cells use surface receptors to sense the shallow chemical gradients that elicit chemotaxis and chemotropism. Slight asymmetries in receptor activation are amplified by downstream signaling systems, which ultimately induce dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. During the mating response of budding yeast, a model chemotropic system, the pheromone receptors on the plasma membrane polarize to the side of the cell closest to the stimulus. Although receptor polarization occurs before and independently of actin cable-dependent delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane (directed secretion), it requires receptor internalization. Phosphorylation of pheromone receptors by yeast casein kinase 1 or 2 (Yck1/2) stimulates their internalization. We showed that the pheromone-responsive G?? dimer promotes the polarization of the pheromone receptor by interacting with Yck1/2 and locally inhibiting receptor phosphorylation. We also found that receptor phosphorylation is essential for chemotropism, independently of its role in inducing receptor internalization. A mathematical model supports the idea that the interaction between G?? and Yck1/2 results in differential phosphorylation and internalization of the pheromone receptor and accounts for its polarization before the initiation of directed secretion.},

Both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of a classifier could be enhanced by performing the classification based only on a set of discriminative genes. Analyzing overlapping between gene expression of different classes is an effective criterion for identifying relevant genes. However, genes selected according to maximizing a relevance score could have rich redundancy.We propose a scheme for minimizing selection redundancy, in which the Proportional Overlapping Score (POS) technique is extended by using a recursive approach to assign a set of complementary discriminative genes. The proposed scheme exploits the gene masks defined by POS to identify more integrated genes in terms of their classification patterns. The approach is validated by comparing its classification performance with other feature selection methods, Wilcoxon Rank Sum, mRMR, MaskedPainter and POS, for several benchmark gene expression datasets using three different classifiers: Random Forest; k Nearest Neighbour; SupportVector Machine. The experimental results of classification error rates show that our proposal achieves a better performance.},

Conserved exons encoding the leucine-rich repeats tend to be overexpressed while others are underused. Mechanistic studies revealed that the underused exons encode part of the protein necessary for interaction with Vimentin and Numa1, a protein which is required for proper positioning of the mitotic spindle. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion of specific SCRIB exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer, which could potentially be exploited to develop more efficient diagnostics and therapies.},

   abstract = {During cancer progression, the genome instability incurred rearrangement could possibly turn some of the tumor suppressor micro-RNAs into pro-oncogenic ones. We aimed to investigate miR-204 in the context of prostate cancer progression using a cell line model of different levels of genome instability (LNCaP, PC3, VCaP and NCI H660), as demonstrated by the availability of ERG fusion. We studied the effect of miR-204 modulation on master transcription factors important for lineage development, cell differentiation and prostate cancer bone marrow metastasis. We followed c-MYB, ETS1 and RUNX2 transcript and protein expression and the miR-204 affected global proteome. We further investigated if these transcription factors exert an effect on miR-204 expression (qPCR, luciferase reporter assay) by silencing them using esiRNA. We found dualistic miR-204 effects, either acting as a tumor suppressor on c-MYB, or as an oncomiR on ETS1. RUNX2 and ETS1 regulation by miR-204 was ERG fusion dependent, demonstrating regulatory circuitry disruption in advanced metastatic models. miR-204 also differentially affected mRNA splicing and protein stability. miR-204 levels were found dependent on cancer hypermethylation and supported by positive feedback induced by all three transcription factors. In this regulatory circuitry among miR-204, c-MYB, RUNX2 and ETS1, the c-MYB was found to induce all three other members, but its expression was differentially affected by the methylation status in lymph node vs. bone metastasis. We demonstrate that not only tumor suppressor micro-RNA loss, but also significant genome rearrangement-driven regulatory loop perturbations play a role in the advanced cancer progression, conferring better pro-survival and metastatic potential.},

   abstract = {Drugs that inhibit estrogen receptor-α (ER) activity have been highly successful in treating and reducing breast cancer progression in ER-positive disease. However, resistance to these therapies presents a major clinical problem. Recent genetic studies have shown that mutations in the ER gene are found in >20% of tumours that progress on endocrine therapies. Remarkably, the great majority of these mutations localize to just a few amino acids within or near the critical helix 12 region of the ER hormone binding domain, where they are likely to be single allele mutations. Understanding how these mutations impact on ER function is a prerequisite for identifying methods to treat breast cancer patients featuring such mutations. Towards this end, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to make a single allele knock-in of the most commonly mutated amino acid residue, tyrosine 537, in the estrogen-responsive MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Genomic analyses using RNA-seq and ER ChIP-seq demonstrated that the Y537S mutation promotes constitutive ER activity globally, resulting in estrogen-independent growth. MCF7-Y537S cells were resistant to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Further, we show that the basal transcription factor TFIIH is constitutively recruited by ER-Y537S, resulting in ligand-independent phosphorylation of Serine 118 (Ser118) by the TFIIH kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7. The CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1 prevented Ser118 phosphorylation and inhibited growth of MCF7-Y537S cells. These studies confirm the functional importance of ER mutations in endocrine resistance, demonstrate the utility of knock-in mutational models for investigating alternative therapeutic approaches and highlight CDK7 inhibition as a potential therapy for endocrine-resistant breast cancer mediated by ER mutations.},

   abstract = {Carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) enable efficient photosynthesis and growth in CO2-limiting environments, and in eukaryotic microalgae localisation of Rubisco to a microcompartment called the pyrenoid is key. In the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Rubisco preferentially relocalises to the pyrenoid during CCM induction and pyrenoid-less mutants lack a functioning CCM and grow very poorly at low CO2. The aim of this study was to investigate the CO2 response of pyrenoid-positive (pyr+) and pyrenoid-negative (pyr–) mutant strains to determine the effect of pyrenoid absence on CCM induction and gene expression. Shotgun proteomic analysis of low-CO2-adapted strains showed reduced accumulation of some CCM-related proteins, suggesting that pyr– has limited capacity to respond to low-CO2 conditions. Comparisons between gene transcription and protein expression revealed potential regulatory interactions, since Rubisco protein linker (EPYC1) protein did not accumulate in pyr– despite increased transcription, while elements of the LCIB/LCIC complex were also differentially expressed. Furthermore, pyr− showed altered abundance of a number of proteins involved in primary metabolism, perhaps due to the failure to adapt to low CO2. This work highlights two-way regulation between CCM induction and pyrenoid formation, and provides novel candidates for future studies of pyrenoid assembly and CCM function.},

   abstract = {Cancer progression is driven by genome instability incurred rearrangements such as transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)/v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene (ERG) that could possibly turn some of the tumor suppressor micro-RNAs into pro-oncogenic ones. Previously, we found dualistic miR-204 effects, acting either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncomiR in ERG fusion-dependent manner. Here, we provided further evidence for an important role of miR-204 for TMPRSS2/ERG and androgen receptor (AR) signaling modulation and fine tuning that prevents TMPRSS2/ERG overexpression in prostate cancer. Based on proximity-based ligation assay, we designed a novel method for detection of TMPRSS2/ERG protein products. We found that miR-204 is TMPRSS2/ERG oncofusion negative regulator, and this was mediated by DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 promoter. Transcriptional factors runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) were positive regulators of TMPRSS2/ERG expression and promoter hypo-methylation. Clustering of patients’ sera for fusion protein, transcript expression, and wild-type ERG transcript isoforms, demonstrated not all patients harboring fusion transcripts had fusion protein products, and only few fusion positive ones exhibited increased wild-type ERG transcripts. miR-204 upregulated AR through direct promoter hypo-methylation, potentiated by the presence of ERG fusion and RUNX2 and ETS1. Proteomics studies provided evidence that miR-204 has dualistic role in AR cancer-related reprogramming, promoting prostate cancer-related androgen-responsive genes and AR target genes, as well as AR co-regulatory molecules. miR-204 methylation regulation was supported by changes in molecules responsible for chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and its regulation. In summary, miR-204 is a mild regulator of the AR function during the phase of preserved AR sensitivity as the latter one is required for ERG-fusion translocation.},

   abstract = {Covalent hemoglobin binding to membranes leads to band 3 (AE1) clustering and the removal of erythrocytes from the circulation; it is also implicated in blood storage lesions. Damaged hemoglobin, with the heme being in a redox and oxygen-binding inactive hemichrome form, has been implicated as the binding species. However, previous studies used strong non-physiological oxidants. In vivo hemoglobin is constantly being oxidised to methemoglobin (ferric), with around 1% of hemoglobin being in this form at any one time. In this study we tested the ability of the natural oxidised form of hemoglobin (methemoglobin) in the presence or absence of the physiological oxidant hydrogen peroxide to initiate membrane binding. The higher the oxidation state of hemoglobin (from Fe(III) to Fe(V)) the more binding was observed, with approximately 50% of this binding requiring reactive sulphydryl groups. The hemoglobin bound was in a high molecular weight complex containing spectrin, ankyrin and band 4.2, which are common to one of the cytoskeletal nodes. Unusually, we showed that hemoglobin bound in this way was redox active and capable of ligand binding. It can initiate lipid peroxidation showing the potential to cause cell damage. In vivo oxidative stress studies using extreme endurance exercise challenges showed an increase in hemoglobin membrane binding, especially in older cells with lower levels of antioxidant enzymes. These are then targeted for destruction. We propose a model where mild oxidative stress initiates the binding of redox active hemoglobin to the membrane. The maximum lifetime of the erythrocyte is thus governed by the redox activity of the cell; from the moment of its release into the circulation the timer is set.},

   abstract = {The marine obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium Thalassolituus oleivorans MIL-1 metabolizes a broad range of aliphatic hydrocarbons almost exclusively as carbon and energy sources. We used LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomics to identify proteins involved in aerobic alkane degradation during growth on medium- (n-C14) or long-chain (n-C28) alkanes. During growth on n-C14, T. oleivorans expresses an alkane monooxygenase system involved in terminal oxidation including two alkane 1-monooxygenases, a ferredoxin, a ferredoxin reductase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase. In contrast, during growth on long-chain alkanes (n-C28), T. oleivorans may switch to a subterminal alkane oxidation pathway evidenced by significant upregulation of Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and an esterase, proteins catalyzing ketone and ester metabolism, respectively. The metabolite (primary alcohol) generated from terminal oxidation of an alkane was detected during growth on n-C14 but not on n-C28 also suggesting alternative metabolic pathways. Expression of both active and passive transport systems involved in uptake of long-chain alkanes was higher when compared to the non-hydrocarbon control, including a TonB-dependent receptor, a FadL homolog and a specialized porin. Also, an inner membrane transport protein involved in the export of an outer membrane protein was expressed. This study has demonstrated the substrate range of T. oleivorans is larger than previously reported with growth from n-C10 up to n-C32. It has also greatly enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of T. oleivorans, a key bacterium that plays a significant role in natural attenuation of marine oil pollution, by identifying key enzymes expressed during the catabolism of n-alkanes.},

   abstract = {Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2T is an important obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium (OHCB) that can dominate microbial communities following marine oil spills. It possesses the ability to degrade branched alkanes which provides it a competitive advantage over many other marine alkane degraders that can only degrade linear alkanes. We used LC–MS/MS shotgun proteomics to identify proteins involved in aerobic alkane degradation during growth on linear (n‐C14) or branched (pristane) alkanes. During growth on n‐C14, A. borkumensis expressed a complete pathway for the terminal oxidation of n‐alkanes to their corresponding acyl‐CoA derivatives including AlkB and AlmA, two CYP153 cytochrome P450s, an alcohol dehydrogenase and an aldehyde dehydrogenase. In contrast, during growth on pristane, an alternative alkane degradation pathway was expressed including a different cytochrome P450, an alcohol oxidase and an alcohol dehydrogenase. A. borkumensis also expressed a different set of enzymes for β‐oxidation of the resultant fatty acids depending on the growth substrate utilized. This study significantly enhances our understanding of the fundamental physiology of A. borkumensis SK2T by identifying the key enzymes expressed and involved in terminal oxidation of both linear and branched alkanes. It has also highlights the differential expression of sets of β‐oxidation proteins to overcome steric hinderance from branched substrates.},

   abstract = {In cold marine environments, the obligate hydrocarbon‐degrading psychrophile Oleispira antarctica RB‐8, which utilizes aliphatic alkanes almost exclusively as substrates, dominates microbial communities following oil spills. In this study, LC–MS/MS shotgun proteomics was used to identify changes in the proteome induced during growth on n‐alkanes and in cold temperatures. Specifically, proteins with significantly higher relative abundance during growth on tetradecane (n‐C14) at 16°C and 4°C have been quantified. During growth on n‐C14, O. antarctica expressed a complete pathway for the terminal oxidation of n‐alkanes including two alkane monooxygenases, two alcohol dehydrogenases, two aldehyde dehydrogenases, a fatty‐acid‐CoA ligase, a fatty acid desaturase and associated oxidoreductases. Increased biosynthesis of these proteins ranged from 3‐ to 21‐fold compared with growth on a non‐hydrocarbon control. This study also highlights mechanisms O. antarctica may utilize to provide it with ecological competitiveness at low temperatures. This was evidenced by an increase in spectral counts for proteins involved in flagella structure/output to overcome higher viscosity, flagella rotation to accumulate cells and proline metabolism to counteract oxidative stress, during growth at 4°C compared with 16°C. Such species‐specific understanding of the physiology during hydrocarbon degradation can be important for parameterizing models that predict the fate of marine oil spills.},

Currently, the proteins and mechanisms involved in NA biodegradation are unknown. Using LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomics, we identified proteins overexpressed during the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 on a model NA (4′-n-butylphenyl)-4-butanoic acid (n-BPBA) and commercial NA mixture (Acros). By day 11, >95% of n-BPBA was degraded. With Acros, a 17% reduction in intensity occurred with 10–18 carbon compounds of the Z family −2 to −14 (major NA species in this mixture). A total of 554 proteins (n-BPBA) and 631 proteins (Acros) were overexpressed during growth on NAs, including several transporters (e.g., ABC transporters), suggesting a cellular protective response from NA toxicity. Several proteins associated with fatty acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism were also overexpressed, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA thioesterase II, which catalyze part of the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Indeed, multiple enzymes involved in the fatty acid oxidation pathway were upregulated. Given the presumed structural similarity between alkyl-carboxylic acid side chains and fatty acids, we postulate that P. fluorescens Pf-5 was using existing fatty acid catabolic pathways (among others) during NA degradation.},
