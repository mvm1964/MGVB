PeptideProphet (via the Philosopher tool kit) is also implemented as an additional PD node to allow validation of MSFragger open (mass-tolerant) search results. These two nodes, along with the existing Percolator validation module, allow users to employ different search strategies and conveniently inspect search results through PD. Our results have demonstrated the improved numbers of PSMs, peptides, and proteins identified by MSFragger coupled with Percolator and significantly faster search speed compared to the conventional SEQUEST/Percolator PD workflows.

   abstract = {Deisotoping, or the process of removing peaks in a mass spectrum resulting from the incorporation of naturally occurring heavy isotopes, has long been used to reduce complexity and improve the effectiveness of spectral annotation methods in proteomics. We have previously described MSFragger, an ultrafast search engine for proteomics, that did not utilize deisotoping in processing input spectra. Here, we present a new, high-speed parallelized deisotoping algorithm, based on elements of several existing methods, that we have incorporated into the MSFragger search engine. Applying deisotoping with MSFragger reveals substantial improvements to database search speed and performance, particularly for complex methods like open or nonspecific searches. Finally, we evaluate our deisotoping method on data from several instrument types and vendors, revealing a wide range in performance and offering an updated perspective on deisotoping in the modern proteomics environment.},

   abstract = {The mating-specific yeast Galpha controls pheromone signaling by sequestering Gbetagamma and by regulating the Fus3 MAP kinase. Disrupting Galpha-Fus3 interaction leads to severe defects in chemotropism. Because Galpha concentrates at the chemotropic growth site where Fus3 is required for the phosphorylation of two known targets, we screened for additional proteins whose phosphorylation depends on pheromone stimulation and Galpha-Fus3 interaction. Using a mutant form of Galpha severely defective in Fus3-binding, Galpha(DSD), and quantitative mass spectrometry, fourteen proteins were identified as potential targets of Galpha-recruited Fus3, ten of which were previously implicated in cell polarity and morphogenesis. To explore the biological relevance of these findings, we focused on the Spa2 polarisome protein, which was hypophosphorylated on multiple serine residues in pheromone-treated Galpha(DSD) cells. Six sites were mutagenized to create the Spa2(6XSA) mutant protein. Spa2(6XSA) exhibited increased affinity for Fus3, consistent with a kinase-substrate interaction, and Spa2(6XSA) cells exhibited dramatic defects in gradient sensing and zygote formation. These results suggest that Galpha promotes the phosphorylation of Spa2 by Fus3 at the cortex of pheromone-stimulated cells, and that this mechanism plays a role in chemotropism. How the Galpha-Fus3 signaling hub affects the other putative targets identified here has yet to be determined. SIGNIFICANCE: Previously, interaction between the G alpha protein, Gpa1, and the MAPK of the pheromone response pathway, Fus3, was shown to be important for efficient sensing of the pheromone gradient and for the maintenance of cell polarity during mating. Here we show that the underlying molecular mechanisms involve the phosphorylation of specific cortical targets of Gpa1/Fus3. These have been identified by quantitative phosphoproteomics using a mutant of Gpa1, which is defective in interacting with Fus3. One of these targets is the polarisome protein Spa2. Alanine substitution of the Spa2 phosphorylation sites targeted by Gpa1/Fus3 lead to a dramatic defect in pheromone gradient sensing and zygote formation. These results reveal how the G alpha protein and the MAPK control cell polarity in a prototypical model system. Our results have wider significance as similar mechanisms exist in higher eukaryotes and are involved in important biological such as neuron development, immunity, and cancer cell metastasis.},

We present a fragment-ion indexing method, and its implementation in peptide identification tool MSFragger, that enables a more than 100-fold improvement in speed over most existing proteome database search tools. Using several large proteomic data sets, we demonstrate how MSFragger empowers the open database search concept for comprehensive identification of peptides and all their modified forms, uncovering dramatic differences in modification rates across experimental samples and conditions. We further illustrate its utility using protein-RNA cross-linked peptide data and using affinity purification experiments where we observe, on average, a 300% increase in the number of identified spectra for enriched proteins. We also discuss the benefits of open searching for improved false discovery rate estimation in proteomics.},

Here we report that, in breast cancer, an additional and hidden dimension of deregulations exists: an unexpected SCRIB exon usage pattern appears to mark a more malignant tumor phenotype and significantly correlates with survival. Conserved exons encoding the leucine-rich repeats tend to be overexpressed while others are underused. Mechanistic studies revealed that the underused exons encode part of the protein necessary for interaction with Vimentin and Numa1, a protein which is required for proper positioning of the mitotic spindle. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion of specific SCRIB exons is a mechanistic hallmark of breast cancer, which could potentially be exploited to develop more efficient diagnostics and therapies.},

   abstract = {Gradient-directed cell migration (chemotaxis) and growth (chemotropism) are processes that are essential to the development and life cycles of all species. Cells use surface receptors to sense the shallow chemical gradients that elicit chemotaxis and chemotropism. Slight asymmetries in receptor activation are amplified by downstream signaling systems, which ultimately induce dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. During the mating response of budding yeast, a model chemotropic system, the pheromone receptors on the plasma membrane polarize to the side of the cell closest to the stimulus. Although receptor polarization occurs before and independently of actin cable-dependent delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane (directed secretion), it requires receptor internalization. Phosphorylation of pheromone receptors by yeast casein kinase 1 or 2 (Yck1/2) stimulates their internalization. We showed that the pheromone-responsive Gbetagamma dimer promotes the polarization of the pheromone receptor by interacting with Yck1/2 and locally inhibiting receptor phosphorylation. We also found that receptor phosphorylation is essential for chemotropism, independently of its role in inducing receptor internalization. A mathematical model supports the idea that the interaction between Gbetagamma and Yck1/2 results in differential phosphorylation and internalization of the pheromone receptor and accounts for its polarization before the initiation of directed secretion.},

Here, we show that when CD74 is overexpressed in human cancer and noncancerous epithelial cells, it interacts and interferes with the function of Scribble, a product of a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, using epithelial cell lines expressing CD74 under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter and quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that, as a result of CD74 overexpression, the phosphorylation pattern of the C-terminal part of Scribble undergoes specific changes. This is accompanied with a translocation of the protein from the sites of cell-to-cell contacts at the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, which is likely to effectively enhance the motility and invasiveness of the cancer cells.},

   abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed, it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry can provide a very sensitive and rapid analysis of protein expression and can be used as an alternative to immunochemical methods to study protein-protein interaction and protein posttranslational modifications. In many circumstances, a functional study, such as one that aims to elucidate a specific signaling pathway or disease state, will require the detection and quantification of a specific set of proteins and their modifications. Very often, there will be no available antibody for some of the proteins in the set, and mass spectrometry will be the only option. This chapter describes a robust and efficient protocol for a small-scale sample preparation and a suite of separation and mass spectrometry techniques that allow the quantitative analysis of low femtomolar amounts of proteins that may be obtained from very limited amount of clinical specimens, affinity techniques, and cell sorting. The protocols can be used by researchers in the applied biomedical field and also in basic cell biology.},

   abstract = {As a budding yeast cell elongates toward its mating partner, cytoplasmic microtubules connect the nucleus to the cell cortex at the growth tip. The Kar3 kinesin-like motor protein is then thought to stimulate plus-end depolymerization of these microtubules, thus drawing the nucleus closer to the site where cell fusion and karyogamy will occur. Here, we show that pheromone stimulates a microtubule-independent interaction between Kar3 and the mating-specific Galpha protein Gpa1 and that Gpa1 affects both microtubule orientation and cortical contact. The membrane localization of Gpa1 was found to polarize early in the mating response, at about the same time that the microtubules begin to attach to the incipient growth site. In the absence of Gpa1, microtubules lose contact with the cortex upon shrinking and Kar3 is improperly localized, suggesting that Gpa1 is a cortical anchor for Kar3. We infer that Gpa1 serves as a positional determinant for Kar3-bound microtubule plus ends during mating.},

Experimental results confirm maximum FWHM resolving power in excess of 350,000 at m/z 524 and 600,000 at m/z 195, isotopic resolution of proteins above 40 kDa, and a single-shot dynamic range of 25,000. It was also found that mass shifts in the new design depend very little on space charge inside the analyzer. This performance was achieved using higher voltages and by careful balancing of construction tolerances and operation parameters, which appeared to vary in narrower ranges of tuning than for a standard Orbitrap analyzer.},

   abstract = {Proteomics is rapidly transforming the way that cancer and other pathologies are investigated. The ability to identify hundreds of proteins and to compare their abundance in different clinical samples presents a unique opportunity for direct identification of novel disease markers. Furthermore, recent advances allow us to analyse and compare PTMs. This gives an additional dimension for defining a new class of protein biomarker based not only on abundance and expression but also on the occurrence of covalent modifications specific to a disease state or therapy response. Such modifications are often a consequence of the activation/inactivation of a particular disease related pathway. In this review we evaluate the available information on breast cancer related protein-phosphorylation events, illustrating the rationale for investigating this PTM as a target for breast cancer research with eventual clinical relevance. We present a critical survey of the published experimental strategies to study protein phosphorylation on a system wide scale and highlight recent specific advances in breast cancer phosphoproteomics. Finally we discuss the feasibility of establishing novel biomarkers for breast cancer based on the detection of patterns of specific protein phosphorylation events.},

By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of >4,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates.},

Through this approach, we have acquired a large amount of peptide fragmentation spectra from size-resolved fractions of the proteomes of several breast tumors, tissue peripheral to the tumor, and samples from patients undergoing noncancer surgery. Label-free quantitation was used to generate protein abundance maps for each proteome and perform comparative analyses. The mass spectrometry data revealed distinct qualitative and quantitative patterns distinguishing the tumors from healthy tissue as well as differences between metastatic and non-metastatic human breast cancers including many established and potential novel candidate protein biomarkers. Selected proteins were evaluated by Western blotting using tumors grouped according to histological grade, size, and receptor expression but differing in nodal status. Immunohistochemical analysis of a wide panel of breast tumors was conducted to assess expression in different types of breast cancers and the cellular distribution of the candidate proteins. These experiments provided further insights and an independent validation of the data obtained by mass spectrometry and revealed the potential of this approach for establishing multimodal markers for early metastasis, therapy outcomes, prognosis, and diagnosis in the future.},

Image current detection is subsequently performed after a stable electrostatic field is achieved. Fourier transformation of the acquired transient allows wide mass range detection with high resolving power, mass accuracy, and dynamic range. The entire instrument operates in LC/MS mode (1 spectrum/s) with nominal mass resolving power of 60,000 and uses automatic gain control to provide high-accuracy mass measurements, within 2 ppm using internal standards and within 5 ppm with external calibration. The maximum resolving power exceeds 100,000 (fwhm). Rapid, automated data-dependent capabilities enable real-time acquisition of up to three high-mass accuracy MS/MS spectra per second.},

Recently developed methods that couple multidimensional liquid chromatography to electrospray mass spectrometers can be used to analyze entire phosphoproteomes. However, they require considerable investments and technical skills that are only available in a few highly specialized laboratories. These methods also appear to be biased. Statistical analyses show that peptides from abundant proteins and multiply phosphorylated peptides are disproportionately identified. We describe an economic alternative that utilizes a phospho-affinity step to isolate the intact phosphoproteins. These are subsequently characterized by electrophoresis and identified by direct de novo sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry. We applied this technique to probe signal-induced changes in the phosphoproteome of human U937 cells, and found that the pools of two cancer-related phosphoproteins implicated in intracellular hormones signaling are dramatically altered in the course of monocyte to macrophage differentiation.},

Bni1p, a formin homologue, is required for this polarized growth by facilitating cortical actin cable assembly. Fus3p, a pheromone-activated MAP kinase, is required for pheromone signaling and cell fusion. We show that Fus3p phosphorylates Bni1p in vitro, and phosphorylation of Bni1p in vivo during the pheromone response is dependent on Fus3p. fus3 mutants exhibited multiple phenotypes similar to bni1 mutants, including defects in actin and cell polarization, as well as Kar9p and cytoplasmic microtubule localization. Disruption of the interaction between Fus3p and the receptor-associated Galpha subunit caused similar mutant phenotypes. After pheromone treatment, Bni1p-GFP and Spa2p failed to localize to the cortex of fus3 mutants, and cell wall growth became completely unpolarized. Bni1p overexpression suppressed the actin assembly, cell polarization, and cell fusion defects. These data suggest a model wherein activated Fus3p is recruited back to the cortex, where it activates Bni1p to promote polarization and cell fusion.},

   abstract = {The mating response of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Although signal transmission by such pathways has been modeled in detail, postreceptor down-regulation is less well understood. The pheromone-responsive G protein alpha subunit (Galpha) of yeast down-regulates the mating signal, but its targets are unknown. We have found that Galpha binds directly to the mating-specific MAPK in yeast cells responding to pheromone. This interaction contributes both to modulation of the mating signal and to the chemotropic response, and it demonstrates direct communication between the top and bottom of a Galpha-MAPK pathway.},
